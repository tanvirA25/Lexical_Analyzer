LEXICAL ANALYZER

The project consist of three programming assignement. Each assignment is to impelemnt the necessary element for a small programming language. 

Assignment 1:
In our first assignment, we're building a lexical analyzer. Our goal is to develop a tool that can read the various tokens or inputs of a program, analyze them, and ensure they form a valid script. We'll be dealing with tokens such as boolean values, string values, numerical values, and operators. Our task also involves defining reserved words like PROGRAM, END, PRINT, IF, and others, which give structure and rules to the way the program should be written. Throughout this assignment, we need to carefully consider all possible formats in which these tokens can appear to ensure they are correctly identified and processed.

Assignemtn 2:
In the second phase of our project, we're diving into building a parser. Our focus here is to comprehend the syntax of the programming language we're creating. Using EBNF notations, we'll define the grammar and syntax rules that will help validate the tokens we introduced in the first assignment. This is a pivotal step in ensuring that the source code adheres to the language's syntactic rules. Our parser will take the stream of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer and arrange them into a structured representation The syntax will provide an organized view of the program's structure and allow us to verify its syntactic correctness.

Assignment 3:

In our final assignment, we're focusing on building an interpreter for our programming language. This interpreter will execute the recursive descent parsing developed in assignment 2, to handle different grammar rules. Our interpreter will be responsible for translating the high-level program structure into actions that the computer can understand and execute. It's a significant challenge, and we'll need to implement error handling mechanisms to provide informative error messages to programmers who are using our language. It is a form of debugger we are implenting to assist programmers in understanding and troubleshooting their code effectively.
